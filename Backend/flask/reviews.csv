"My son loves this in his bedroom with the light. He plays calming music and the lights will change colors with the music. He loves to ask it questions, play games and jokes. He has started to find his own kid music that I never knew existed. Its a great size to have them both side by side to each other on a night stand. We got the green decor backing for kids which is nice because it has a grip, just in case!",1
"My 7 year old loves echo show so I thought this would be great for her. It did not disappoint. I love that it is especially set up for a child to use. I don’t have to worry about her accidentally getting on something she shouldn’t be. It has jokes for kids, songs, everything is tailored to them specifically. The skin is also a great, fun feature. It stands out and just has a fun vibe! Easy to set up, responds well to her voice and good sound quality.",1
Love have all over house,1
I switched them to the Alexa Show so they have an actual clock to look at and they love it. Especially now they can see out the front door with our Ring camera.,1
Very limited on the kids mode. Disabled it and workes well,1

"My kids love it, they play music, sing along, ask it questions, put white noise to help them sleep, etc. Great for dropping in and checking on them when we are downstairs.",1
Worth the money,1
This was a gift for my son. The sound quality is wonderful and he’s able to watch his favorite shows on it. I can’t say enough great things about it!,1
Got this on sale and it is awesome to be able to check in on another room if I need to! And with amazon plus kids can get a wide variety of cool stuff to do some of which is actually educational!!,1
