I love these jeans so much they are stretchy and comfy yet so flattering. Love the little flair. By far my favorite jeans and the price is right. Wish they’d have a lot more color options I’d buy them all!,1
These jeans fit great and are perfect length for my 5' 3.5' self!,1

"I was a little nervous about these but they’re awesome. I ordered a medium (I’m 5’5, about 155 lbs) they fit great and look exactly as pictured.",1
So comfortable and stylish! Ordered the medium (as recommended by Amazon)and they fit perfectly! They have just enough stretch without being too baggy. I’m 5’3” and weigh 156,1
"I love these jeans. My only complaint is they are too long. I'm 5'7"" and these reach the tops of my shoes. Was hoping for something a little more cropped. They are adorable and super comfy though.",1
Fit perfectly and arrived on time!,1
